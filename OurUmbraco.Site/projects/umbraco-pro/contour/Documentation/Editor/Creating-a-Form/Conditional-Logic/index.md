#Setting up conditional logic on fields

Only showing a field if the value of another field is ... That's what you can do with conditional logic.

##Example form
Take a look at the following as an example

![Example form](ExampleForm.png)

It make sense to only show the email/phone field when that corresponds with the option chosen in the 'how should we contact you?' field.

##Enabling conditional logic

Enabling conditions for a field can be done on the additional settings of a field.

Simply check the enable conditions box and you should then see more options

###Action type

First thing that needs to be chosen is the action type this can be either show or hide

- Show: the field will be hidden unless the rules match
- Hide: the field will be hidden if the rules match

###Logic type

Then you'll need to specify if all rules need to match (but this setting is only important whne you have multple rules.

![LogicType](LogicType.png)

- All: all of the rules must match
- Any: any of the rules may match

##Adding a new rule

When adding a new rule you'll need to select the field where you want to evaluate the value and then you can also select an operator.

In this example I only want to show the email field if the value of the 'how should we contact you' field is 'Email'

Don't forget to hit the add icon so the new rule get's added

##Result

If I setup a similar rule for the phone field I get the following result

By default the email and phone field are hidden but when I select the corresponding option from the 'how should we contact you' field it get's shown
