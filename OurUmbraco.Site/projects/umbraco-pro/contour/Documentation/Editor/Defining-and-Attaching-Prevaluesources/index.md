#Defining and attaching prevaluesources
Prevalue sources can be hooked to fields that use a list fieldtype (radiobuttonlist, checkboxlist, dropdownlist). Making it possible to retrieve a list of items from a certain source.

##Setting up a prevalue sources
Prevalue sources can be managed in the corresponding part of the Contour section

###Create new prevalue source

Right click the prevalue source tree and select create, you should get a new modal where you'll need to provide a name for the new prevalue source

###Fill in settings
Depending on the type you'll need to provide some additional settings

In this example I am using the 'get values from textfile' type and providing a .txt file that contains

	example value 1
	example value 2
	example value 3
	example value 4
	example value 5

###Save the prevalue source
Once the settings are populated save the prevalue source by hitting the save icon in the toolbar

###Watch preview of the values
If the settings are succesfully validated and they return results you should get an overview of the values.

##Attaching a prevalue source to a field
Now move to the form where you want to use the prevalue source add or edit a field and go to the additional settings (the fieldtype has to support prevalues so checkboxlist, radiobuttonlist, dropdownlist). When there is at least 2 prevalue source you should now see a new option called prevalue type where we can choose standard or 1 of the available prevalue sources.

Choose the correct type (so the name of the prevalue source) and add/update the field, you should now see a render of the field in the designer using the values coming from the attached source

###SQL Database (Read only)
Connects to a OLEDB compatible Database Table and constructs a prevalue source from it
