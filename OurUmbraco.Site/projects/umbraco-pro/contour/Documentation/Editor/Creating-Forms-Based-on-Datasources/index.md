#Creating forms based on data sources
It's possible to automaticly create forms based on a data source (like an sql database table) that will also post record data to that source. All that's needed is to follow a wizard and your form will be autogenerated and hooked up to the specified source.

##Setting up a datasource
Datasource are managed in the datasource part of the Contour section
