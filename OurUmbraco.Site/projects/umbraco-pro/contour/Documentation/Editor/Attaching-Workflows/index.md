#Attaching workflows
Submitting a Contour form will result in the record data being stored in the database, if you wish to attach extra functionality to your form you can do so by assigning 1 or multiple workflows (like sending an email).

##Adding a workflow

###Navigate to the workflow page for your form
You can either hit the workflow button on the form designer toolbar
