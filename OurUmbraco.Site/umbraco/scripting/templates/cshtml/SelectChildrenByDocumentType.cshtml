LIST CHILDREN BY TYPE
=================================
This snippet shows how simple it is to fetch only children of a certain Document Type using Razor. Instead of
calling .Children, simply call .AliasOfDocumentType (even works in plural for readability)! 
For instance .Textpage or .Textpages (you can find the alias of your Document Type by editing it in the 
Settings section).

NOTE: It is safe to remove this comment (anything between @ * * @), the code that generates the list is only the below!

<ul>
    @foreach (var item in @Model.Textpages.Where("Visible"))
    {
    <li><a href="@item.Url">@item.Name</a></li>
}
</ul>
