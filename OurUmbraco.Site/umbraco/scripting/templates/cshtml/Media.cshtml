USING MEDIA
=================================
This snippet shows two ways of working with referenced media. Media is referenced from a page using a property with
the type of 'MediaPicker' (or similar for instance MultiNodePicker in uComponents).

How it works:
- First we check that there's a property on the current page called 'relatedMedia' and that it has a selected value
- In the first example we simply needs the path of the media which is stored in the property 'umbracoFile' and the 
  media is referenced in the property with the alias of 'relatedMedia'. One line is all it takes!
- In the second example we store the referenced media in a variable as we'd like to get not just the path but also
  the name of the media for the friendly alt attribute.
  
NOTE: It is safe to remove this comment (anything between @ * * @), the code that generates the list is only the below!

@inherits umbraco.MacroEngines.DynamicNodeContext
@if (Model.HasProperty("relatedMedia") && Model.RelatedMedia != 0) {
	<p>Simple: <br />
		<img src='@Model.Media("relatedMedia", "umbracoFile")' />
	</p>

	<p>Advanced: <br />
		@{
			var image = @Model.Media("relatedMedia");
		}
		<img src='@image.UmbracoFile' alt='@image.Name' />
	</p>
} else {
	<p>
		This page doesn't contain a MediaPicker property with the alias of 'RelatedMedia' 
		or No image is selected on this page
	</p>
}
