#Templating

_Templating in Umbraco 4 consists of 2 larger concepts, namely Masterpages, and Macros. Masterpages are used for the html layout of your pages, whereas macros are resuable dynamic components used for embedding navigation, forms, list and so on in your templates._

In **Umbraco 4.10.0 MVC** templating was introduced as an alternative to Masterpages, you can find a full reference [here](../Mvc/index.md).
